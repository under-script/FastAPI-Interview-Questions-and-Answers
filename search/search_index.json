Known for its high speed, FastAPI is touted to be one of the quickest Python frameworks available, only outpaced by NodeJS and Go.</p> <p>What sets FastAPI apart from other frameworks is its intuitive nature. It\u2019s designed to be easy-to-use while still maintaining high performance levels. Moreover, it provides automatic interactive API documentation, which can significantly streamline the development process.</p> <p>In this article, we delve into an extensive list of interview questions centered around FastAPI. These questions encompass fundamental concepts as well as more intricate aspects of this powerful framework. Whether you\u2019re a beginner looking to get your feet wet or an experienced developer wanting to brush up your knowledge, these questions will provide valuable insights into the workings of FastAPI.</p>"},{"location":"interviewprep.org/can-you-describe-how-you-would-handle-cors-cross-origin-resource-sharing-in-fastapi/","title":"Can you describe how you would handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in FastAPI?","text":"<p>FastAPI has a built-in middleware for managing CORS, which can be added to the application instance. To enable it, import CORSMiddleware from fastapi.middleware.cors and add it to your FastAPI app using the .add_middleware() method. You need to specify parameters like allow_origins (a list of origins that are allowed), allow_credentials (whether cookies can be supported), allow_methods (HTTP methods allowed), and allow_headers (which HTTP headers are permitted). Here\u2019s an example:</p> <pre><code>from fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\norigins = [\"http://localhost:3000\"]\n\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=origins,\n    allow_credentials=True,\n    allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def main():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"interviewprep.org/can-you-explain-how-path-parameters-and-query-parameters-are-used-in-fastapi/","title":"Can you explain how path parameters and query parameters are used in FastAPI?","text":"<p>FastAPI uses path parameters and query parameters to extract data from a URL. Path parameters are defined in the route\u2019s URL, enclosed in curly braces {}. They\u2019re used to capture specific values from the path itself. For example, @app.get(\u201c/items/{item_id}\u201d) would capture the item_id from the URL.</p> <p>Query parameters, on the other hand, are appended after the URL following a question mark ?. They allow optional information to be passed into the function. For instance, @app.get(\u201c/items/\u201d) might accept \u2018skip\u2019 and \u2018limit\u2019 as query parameters to control pagination.</p> <p>In both cases, FastAPI automatically validates these parameters, generates error messages when data is invalid, and provides interactive documentation for them.</p>"},{"location":"interviewprep.org/can-you-explain-how-you-would-implement-authentication-and-authorization-in-fastapi/","title":"Can you explain how you would implement authentication and authorization in FastAPI?","text":"<p>FastAPI provides a security module to implement authentication and authorization.

However, there are cases where using HTTP protocol directly might be preferred. One such case could be when dealing with low-level network operations or custom protocols.</p> <p>For instance, if we need to implement a WebSocket server that communicates via a specific binary protocol, FastAPI\u2019s dependency injection may not provide the necessary control over the raw data stream. In this scenario, it would be more appropriate to use an ASGI server like Uvicorn or Hypercorn directly along with Python\u2019s built-in asyncio library for handling asynchronous I/O operations.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a simplified example of how you might set up a WebSocket server using Uvicorn:</p> <pre><code>import uvicorn\nfrom starlette.websockets import WebSocket\n\nasync def app(scope, receive, send):\n    websocket = WebSocket(scope, receive, send)\n    await websocket.accept()\n    while True:\n        data = await websocket.receive_text()\n        # Process data here...\n        await websocket.send_text(f\"Processed: {data}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000)\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, we have direct access to the incoming data stream and can process it as needed without any abstraction layers introduced by FastAPI\u2019s dependency injection system.</p>"},{"location":"interviewprep.org/fastapi-is-built-on-top-of-starlette-for-the-web-parts-and-pydantic-for-the-data-parts-can-you-explain-how-these-work-together-to-provide-fastapi-s-functionality/","title":"FastAPI is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

This allows for concurrent processing of requests, improving application performance. When a FastAPI route is defined with an async function, it becomes a coroutine that can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime.</p> <p>For instance:</p> <pre><code>from fastapi import FastAPI\napp = FastAPI()\n@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def read_root():\n    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, read_root is an asynchronous function. If it calls another async function with await, execution returns to the event loop, freeing up resources until the awaited function completes.</p> <p>This non-blocking nature of async I/O operations means your app can handle more requests with fewer resources, as idle time waiting for I/O (like network or disk access) can be used to serve other requests. It also simplifies code by avoiding callback hell or threading complexities, making it easier to write and maintain.</p>"},{"location":"interviewprep.org/how-can-you-serve-static-files-with-fastapi/","title":"How can you serve static files with FastAPI?","text":"<p>FastAPI can serve static files using the StaticFiles class from starlette.staticfiles.

Here's an example of how you can implement data validation and serialization in FastAPI.</p> <p>First, you'll need to define a Pydantic model to represent the expected structure of incoming data. Pydantic provides a way to define data schemas and perform type validation. Here's an example of a Pydantic model for a user entity:</p> <pre><code>from pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n</code></pre> <p>Next, you can define an API route in FastAPI, specifying the expected input and output types using your Pydantic model. Here's an example of a route that handles POST requests for creating a new user:</p> <pre><code>from fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi import HTTPException\nfrom your_module import User\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"/users\")\nasync def create_user(user: User):\n    # Perform data validation\n    if not is_valid_email(user.email):\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"Invalid email\")\n\n    # Perform data serialization and store the user\n\n    # Return the created user\n    return user\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code, the <code>create_user</code> route expects a JSON payload containing user data, which will be automatically validated against the <code>User</code> Pydantic model. If any validation errors occur, FastAPI will automatically handle them and return the appropriate response.</p> <p>You could also perform additional validation, such as checking if the email is valid, and raise an exception with a specific HTTP status code and error message, as demonstrated in the code above. For data serialization, FastAPI automatically converts the returned <code>user</code> object into JSON before sending it back as the response. This enables consistent and standardized communication between the client and server.</p> <p>By utilizing Pydantic models and FastAPI's built-in validation and serialization mechanisms, you can ensure that your FastAPI application handles incoming data correctly while providing clear and informative responses.</p>"},{"location":"javainuse.com/can-you-provide-an-example-of-how-you-would-deploy-a-fastapi-application-in-a-production-environment/","title":"Can you provide an example of how you would deploy a FastAPI application in a production environment?","text":"<p>To deploy a FastAPI application in a production environment, you will typically follow a set of steps that involve setting up a web server, configuring the application, and integrating it with any necessary tools or services.
