FastAPI integrates with GraphQL through the use of Starletteâ€™s GraphQLApp. This allows FastAPI to handle HTTP requests and responses, while GraphQLApp manages the execution of GraphQL queries. The integration process involves creating a GraphQL schema using Graphene library, then passing this schema to GraphQLApp which is added as a route in FastAPI application. This setup enables handling of GraphQL queries at specified endpoint. For mutations or subscriptions, additional configurations are required.
