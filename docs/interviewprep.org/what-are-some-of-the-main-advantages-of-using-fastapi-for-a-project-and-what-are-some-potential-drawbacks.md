FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It offers several advantages such as high performance comparable to NodeJS and Go thanks to Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. FastAPI also provides easy-to-use features for declaring request parameters and body, automatic interactive API documentation, dependency injection system, OAuth2 integration, among others.

However, it has some drawbacks. Being relatively new, its community is smaller compared to Flask or Django which means fewer resources and plugins available. Also, while its simplicity can be an advantage, it may not be suitable for complex applications that require more robust features provided by mature frameworks like Django.
