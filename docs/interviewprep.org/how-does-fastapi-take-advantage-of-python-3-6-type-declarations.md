FastAPI utilizes Python 3.6 type declarations to provide several benefits. It uses these annotations for data validation, serialization, and documentation while reducing the amount of code required. FastAPI leverages Pydantic models that use type hints to perform automatic request body JSON parsing, form data handling, and query parameter handling. This results in cleaner, more maintainable code. Additionally, it generates interactive API documentation automatically using OpenAPI standards based on these type declarations.
