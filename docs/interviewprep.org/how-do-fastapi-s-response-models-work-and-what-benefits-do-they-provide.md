FastAPI’s response models are Python classes that define the structure and data types of HTTP responses. They leverage Pydantic for data validation, serialization, and documentation. When a route function returns a Pydantic model, FastAPI automatically converts it into JSON, checks the data against the model’s schema, and generates an OpenAPI schema.

The benefits include:
1. Data Validation: Ensures only valid data is returned.
2. Serialization: Converts complex data types to JSON.
3. Documentation: Auto-generates API docs based on the model.
4. Code Reusability: Models can be reused across different routes.
5. Error Handling: Automatically handles errors when data doesn’t match the model.
