FastAPI utilizes Starlette for web routing and Pydantic for data validation and serialization. When a request is made, Starlette handles the HTTP specifics, such as path operations and requests/responses. It also provides asynchronous capabilities. Pydantic comes into play by validating incoming JSON data against predefined models, ensuring type correctness. If valid, it serializes the data into Python types that can be used in your application. These two components work together to provide FastAPIâ€™s core functionality: fast, easy-to-use, and robust API development with automatic interactive documentation.
