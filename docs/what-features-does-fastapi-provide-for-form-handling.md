FastAPI provides robust form handling features. It uses Python type hints to validate incoming data, ensuring that it matches the expected format. This includes checking for required fields and validating field types. FastAPI also supports nested models for complex forms with sub-forms or lists of sub-forms. Additionally, it allows for custom validation using Pydanticâ€™s @validator decorator, enabling more complex checks beyond simple type validation. Furthermore, FastAPI can automatically generate interactive documentation for your API including form parameters, making it easier for users to understand how to interact with your endpoints.
