FastAPI and Flask are both popular Python web frameworks, but they have distinct differences. FastAPI is designed for high-performance APIs and leverages modern Python features such as type hints and asynchronous programming. It provides automatic documentation generation and has built-in support for data validation and dependency injection. Flask, on the other hand, is a more lightweight framework that offers simplicity and flexibility. It is suitable for smaller projects and doesn't have the same level of performance optimizations as FastAPI.
