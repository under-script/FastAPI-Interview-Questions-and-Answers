One of the standout features of FastAPI is its automatic generation of interactive API documentation. FastAPI uses the OpenAPI standard to generate comprehensive API documentation that includes request and response models, data types, validation rules, and even allows users to test API endpoints directly from the documentation. This feature saves developers a significant amount of time and effort in writing and maintaining separate documentation.
