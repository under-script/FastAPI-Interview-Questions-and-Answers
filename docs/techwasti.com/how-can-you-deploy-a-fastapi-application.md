FastAPI applications can be deployed using various methods. You can deploy FastAPI on traditional web servers like Nginx or Apache using WSGI adapters such as Gunicorn or uWSGI. Another option is to use ASGI servers like Uvicorn or Hypercorn, which are specifically designed for asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI. Additionally, FastAPI can be deployed as serverless functions on platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
