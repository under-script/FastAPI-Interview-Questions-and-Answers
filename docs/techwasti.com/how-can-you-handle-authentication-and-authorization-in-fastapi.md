FastAPI provides easy integration with authentication and authorization mechanisms. You can use third-party libraries like OAuth2 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to implement secure authentication and authorization. FastAPI's OAuth2 support allows you to define scopes and permissions for different API routes, ensuring fine-grained access control.
