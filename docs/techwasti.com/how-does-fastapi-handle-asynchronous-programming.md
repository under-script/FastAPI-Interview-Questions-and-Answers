FastAPI fully supports asynchronous programming, leveraging Python's asyncio library. It allows you to define asynchronous endpoints using the `async def` syntax, enabling you to write concurrent code that efficiently handles multiple requests. Asynchronous support in FastAPI significantly boosts performance, allowing your API to handle more concurrent users without sacrificing responsiveness.
