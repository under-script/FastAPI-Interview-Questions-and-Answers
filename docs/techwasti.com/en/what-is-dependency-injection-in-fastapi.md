Dependency injection is a powerful design pattern used in FastAPI to manage dependencies and ensure cleaner, modular code. FastAPI's dependency injection system allows you to declare dependencies directly in the function signature. These dependencies can be any Python objects, including databases, services, or configurations. FastAPI takes care of creating and managing these dependencies, making your code more maintainable and testable.
