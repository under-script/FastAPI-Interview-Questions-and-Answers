Setting up a FastAPI application from scratch involves a few key steps. Here's a high-level overview along with a code snippet to get you started:

Step 1: Install FastAPI
You'll need to have Python and pip installed on your machine. Then, you can use pip to install FastAPI by running the command:
```
pip install fastapi
```
Step 2: Create a New Python File
Create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) that will serve as the entry point for your FastAPI application. Step 3: Import Dependencies
In your `main.py` file, import the required FastAPI module and any additional dependencies you may need. For example:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
```
Step 4: Initialize FastAPI App
Instantiate a FastAPI application object using the `FastAPI()` constructor:
```python
app = FastAPI()
```
Step 5: Define Routes and Handlers
Add route handlers to handle incoming requests. You can define different routes using FastAPI decorators and Python functions. For example:
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```
Step 6: Run the Application
At the end of your `main.py` file, add code to run the FastAPI application. For example:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```
Step 7: Start the Server
Now you can start the server by running the `main.py` file using the Python interpreter:
```
python main.py
```
By following these steps, you can set up a basic FastAPI application from scratch. Keep in mind that this is just the beginning, and you can further customize and enhance your application based on your specific requirements.
