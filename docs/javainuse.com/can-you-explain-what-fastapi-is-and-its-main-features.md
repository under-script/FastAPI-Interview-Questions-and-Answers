FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is known for its exceptional speed and simplicity, making it a popular choice for developing high-performance web applications.

One of the main features of FastAPI is its incredible speed. It achieves this by leveraging Python's type hints for automatic data validation and serialization, which eliminates the need for manual input processing. This makes it highly efficient and reduces the amount of code needed, allowing developers to build APIs quickly.

FastAPI also provides asynchronous support using the powerful `asyncio` library. This allows the application to handle concurrent requests efficiently, resulting in improved performance. Additionally, FastAPI is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic - two highly optimized libraries for web applications and data validation respectively.

Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate the simplicity and speed of FastAPI:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```
In this example, we define a simple API endpoint to retrieve items by their `item_id`. The `item_id` is defined as an integer path parameter, and an optional `q` parameter is also present. FastAPI automatically handles the type conversion and validation for the request parameters. The response is a dictionary containing the item ID and the query parameter.

To start the FastAPI application, we would typically execute the following command in the terminal: `uvicorn main:app --reload`. This would start the server, and we could access the API by sending GET requests to `http://localhost:8000/items/{item_id}?q={query}`.

In conclusion, FastAPI is a modern web framework that excels in speed, simplicity, and performance. Its utilization of Python type hints, asynchronous support, and integration with other powerful libraries makes it a top choice for building high-performance APIs quickly.
