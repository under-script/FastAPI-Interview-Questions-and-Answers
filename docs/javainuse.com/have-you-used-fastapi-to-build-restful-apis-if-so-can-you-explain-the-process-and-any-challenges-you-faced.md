FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It comes with built-in support for asynchronous programming, allowing you to take advantage of the benefits of concurrency.
To get started with FastAPI, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Install FastAPI:
 ```
 pip install fastapi
 ```
2. Create a new Python file, such as `main.py`, and import the necessary modules:
 ```python
 from fastapi import FastAPI
 ```
3. Initialize the FastAPI application:
 ```python
 app = FastAPI()
 ```
4. Define your API endpoints using decorators and corresponding functions:
 ```python
 @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
 def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
     return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
 ```
5. Run the application:
 ```python
 uvicorn main:app --reload
 ```
This code snippet sets up a basic endpoint using FastAPI. When you access `/items/{item_id}` (e.g., `/items/42`), it will call the `read_item` function and return a JSON response.

As for challenges, one common issue developers face when using FastAPI is ensuring correct handling of request and response objects. FastAPI provides request validation based on type hints, but it's important to properly handle potential errors and exceptions that may occur during validation. Additionally, interacting with databases or external services asynchronously may introduce complexities. It's crucial to carefully manage and handle potential race conditions or ensure proper synchronization.

Remember that the code snippet and challenges provided above are from a general perspective. When working on a specific project, factors such as data models, database integration, security, and scalability should be considered.
Please note that the code provided here is for illustrative purposes and may not run without the necessary dependencies and configurations. It's always recommended to consult the official FastAPI documentation and adapt the code to your specific use case.
